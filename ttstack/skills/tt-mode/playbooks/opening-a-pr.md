### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main; subagents inherit it. Multiple `Task` calls on the same branch each get their own worktree, or `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` between them. Dirty branch with unrelated work: patch out, fresh worktree, apply. Snarled worktree: reset from main, redo minimally.

**Commits.** Commit liberally; rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit; new commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run `/deslop` over the diff before commit. Run `/no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/technical-writing`, then apply `/unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `drafts` or `tt-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Apply the same `/technical-writing` and `/unslop` pass as the body. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(tt-mode): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a briefing, not the lab notebook. A reviewer who has the diff should learn why the change exists, what it leaves out, what it could break, and how you proved it works, in under a minute. Write short, simple sentences with few identifiers. Do not write walls of text. The squash commit body is the PR body. If the body would make the squash commit longer than about 40 lines, cut the body.

Put each section under a `##` heading, not a bold lead-in, so the sections stand apart. Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it has nothing to say.

- `## Why` gives the problem and the approach in one to three short sentences. Do not list SHAs or rebase genealogy. Do not add a "based on main" preamble.
- `## What changed` has one to three short bullets. Name a real symbol or path only when it carries the change. Name both sides of a rename or retarget.
- `## Scope` always names what the PR covers and what it deliberately leaves out, for example a related follow-up or a known gap. Use one to three short items. Do not list symbols or paths, and do not write a file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs` names only rejected alternatives that a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip this section when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius` gives one or two sentences on who or what the change touches and why that is safe or risky. If main is red, state the cost of leaving it red.
- `## Verification` has one to three bullets. Each bullet names a real run path and its outcome, such as `control-cli`, `control-ui`, or the targeted tests. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. For a UI change, paste the `check-matrix` coverage line and link the matrix. When the matrix does not pass, say so here instead of leaving it out. Link the arena or swarm directory for the remaining evidence. Do not include sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, or "CLEAN" verdicts. Put these details in a linked artifact. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. Stack follow-ups onto the parent branch so the host keeps the order. Commands are in `docs/code-host.md`. Branch from main only for independent work. Rebase onto the parent branch, or onto `main` when the PR targets trunk, before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. Cloud-agent PR tools default to draft, so set draft false on every create. If a PR still opens as a draft, run the host's ready command from the code-host file. View the PR through that file before you refer to its status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR runs `interrogate`, `/deslop`, and `/no-comments`. It returns the URL and does not babysit, unless it is an Autopilot-full or Autopilot-review owner. That owner's brief assigns the babysit loop and is the ask `playbooks/babysit.md` waits for. Return to the parent.
